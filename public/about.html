<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Ishaan Dugar, an Undergraduate student at NUS(National University of Singapore) and I am currently pursuing
  Electrical Engineering. It has been a great semester for me until now and I hope to enjoy my remaining semsesters
  the same. 
</p>

<p>I am currently 18 years old and I've recently got my driver's license as well. I am slowly entering into
  the world of adults and it is very scary. But I'm still excited and looking forward to the future. I enjoy sports
  like badmintor, table tennis, swimming, cricket, etc. Though I'm not a professional, I look forward to giving a
  decent performance in my games.
</p>

<p>In the future, I would like to get a high paying job, or become a successful businessman that earns a lot of money
  because I want a lot of things. These may not be needs, but still they're wants, and I want to achieve them ASAP. 
  One is to buy a BIG and royal house for my family and gift my family members their favorite cars, then I want to own
  either of a Porche 911 GT3RS or a Mclaren 720S. I will never prefer an electrical vehicle over a petroleum based one.
